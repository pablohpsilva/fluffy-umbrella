Here's the exercise:

> The goal of the exercise is to create a list of test-takers (test-takers can be seen as users).
>
> _Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)_. Create a component that enables you to load the data from the service created during step 1 and display the names of the test takers.
>
> Nice to have: The component should be reused to display other kinds of data.

**This is a component library!**

Dependencies:

-   React
